This is my current work in progress! A desktop app helping to choose movies or series from Netflix, Disney+ & Co.
Streaming services have way too many interesting movies to watch. Maybe the problem of making a decision here sounds familiar to you!
My idea was to select 3 movies or series and let the program decide for me or using a second try.  

# Technologies
This idea grew over time and I started a very simple version last year without any GUI or database. 
The front-end is made with JavaFX and for the back-end I plan to use an embedded H2 database. For OR-Mapping JPA/Hibernate.
